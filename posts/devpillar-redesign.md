[![DevPillar Redesign](/devpillar/split.png)](https://devpillar.org)

## **Introduction**

After a brief hiatus. I came back to DevPillar for a redesign. I wanted to make it more community-focused, and grow it as an Open Source project. I also wanted to make it look better.

I think I did a pretty good job. The website is also a lot faster now due to some optimizations I made with passing props & data fetching. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than it was before.

---

## **1. Total UI Overhaul**

- _New sidebar and overall website feel._
- _More sophisticated and compact layout._
- _Geist font._
- _Light & Dark mode._

The majority of work was done on the UI. Overall, the new design is much more sophisticated and compact.

Here's a quick rundown of the changes:

### **Hero**

![Hero Section](/devpillar/hero.png)

- _Newsletter CTA is now one of the first things the user sees._
- _Cleaner design._
- _Number of resources clearly displayed._

### **Resource Cards**

![Resource Cards](/devpillar/resource-cards.png)

- _Compact design._
- _Design allows for dense, or spaced layouts._
- _Design is consistent with the rest of the site._

### **Sidebar & Categories**

- _New sidebar design._
- _Categories are now more organized._
- _Easier to read._

### Page Layouts

![Route Layouts](/devpillar/page-layouts.png)

- _New layouts for categories, search, profile, etc._
- _Stylish headings for each page._
- _Buttons to submit resources on every page._
- _Consistent layout across all pages._
- _Sort method now in heading & doens't take up extra space._

### Footer

![Footer](/devpillar/footer.png)

- _Consistent with rest of the site._
- _Simple & to the point._
- _Newsletter CTA._

### Login Page

![Login Page](/devpillar/login.png)

- _Clean design._
- _No more weird layout shifts._
- _Added Google sign-in._

### Dark Mode

![Dark Mode](/devpillar/dark-mode.png)

- _Dark mode looks pretty good._
- _So does light mode._
- _What else is there to say?_

And thats basically it for the UI, among other minor tweaks. I think it looks great, and blows the last design out of the water.

## **2. Resource Submissions**

![Resource Submissions](/devpillar/contributions.png)

Another core change is how submissions are handled. Previously they hit an API endpoint via a (very poorly designed) dialog form, and were stored in a Supabase table for me to go through later.

Now, they're community-driven and managed through pull requests on GitHub. I really feel like this will improve the user experience and promote a stronger community presence.

_Fun fact: the old design had a secret `/requests` page that I would use to log and track the resources. It was a disaster._

---

## **3. Updated Categories**

With a new sidebar, comes updates to the categories.

Before, I had 41 categories, which was a bit much. Now, there are 10 main categories, and each one has it's own subcategories. This makes it much easier to find resources, and much easier to manage.

## **10. Next Upâ€¦**

_Current goals for DevPillar are to add a TON of new resources, and do some marketing to get new users and hopefully grow the project. I would love for it to become self-sufficient and grow via mostly community engagement._

Moving forward, the plan is to add a bunch of new resources and ramp up marketing efforts to attract more users.

The ultimate goal is for DevPillar to become self-sufficient and grow predominantly through community engagement.

---

## **Conclusion**

It's a new chapter ladies & gentlemen. I'm grateful to those who pushed me to continue this project.

At one point, I didn't think anybody was using it. Now I see that's not the case, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

The website is faster, more beautiful, and more user-focused than ever before. I'm excited to see where it goes from here.

Well that about wraps it up. If you have any questions, or want to share your thoughts, I'm always happy to hear them.

Cheers,

Noah
